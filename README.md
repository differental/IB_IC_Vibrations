# Engineering IB Integrated Coursework - Earthquake Resistant Structures

## Warning!

You are welcome to use our code as a faster and more convenient alternative to the department's Matlab code. However, since these scripts are part of our project, please ensure proper citation. Including a link to this repository in your report or presentation is sufficient.

You may change and redistribute our code however you like, provided that you link our repo.

## Our Tasks

Q1. Compare, for example, the effects of using 1, 10, 100 and 1000 absorbers tuned to slightly different frequencies (with the same total mass in each case). Which gives the widest spread?

Q2. What is the minimum total mass of absorbers required to reduce the maximum (harmonic) response of the structure to, say, 10% of its value with no absorbers?

Q3. How does the damping factor of absorber masses affect the results with multiple absorbers?
