# Engineering IB Integrated Coursework - Earthquake Resistant Structures

Tasks:

Q1. Compare, for example, the effects of using 1, 10, 100 and 1000 absorbers tuned to slightly different frequencies (with the same total mass in each case). Which gives the widest spread?

Q2. What is the minimum total mass of absorbers required to reduce the maximum (harmonic) response of the structure to, say, 10% of its value with no absorbers?

Q3. How does the damping factor of absorber masses affect the results with multiple absorbers?
